            <p>The Green Bay Pakers became a football team on August 11, 1919, in Green Bay Wisonsin.
                Green Bay's pro football team was born in the second-floor editorial room of the old 
                Green Bay Press-Gazette newspaper building. There was nothing even written about the formation of the team in the next day's newspaper. Two days later, there was a story published saying the new team would be sponsored by the Indian Packing Co. and be known as the Packers.

            <p>On August 27, 1921, the Packers were granted a franchise in the American Professional Football Association, a new national pro football league that had been formed the previous year. The APFA changed its name to the National Football League.
                The Packers won the very <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_I"> first Super Bowl</a> in 1967 against the Kansas it Cheifs. This began a rivalry between the two teams that continue to this day. (Packers will always be &gt; than the Cheifs).
