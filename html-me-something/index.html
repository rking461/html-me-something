                <p id="firstColor">The Green Bay Pakers became a football team on August 11, 1919, in Green Bay Wisonsin.
                Green Bay's pro football team was born in the second-floor editorial room of the old 
                Green Bay Press-Gazette newspaper building. There was nothing even written about the formation of the team in the next day's newspaper. Two days later, there was a story published saying the new team would be sponsored by the Indian Packing Co. and be known as the Packers.

            <p id="secondColor">On August 27, 1921, the Packers were granted a franchise in the American Professional Football Association, a new national pro football league that had been formed the previous year. The APFA changed its name to the National Football League.
                The Packers won the very <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_I"> first Super Bowl</a> in 1967 against the Kansas it Cheifs. This began a rivalry between the two teams that continue to this day. (Packers will always be &gt; than the Cheifs).
                The Packes biggest rivals is the Chicago Bears.

            <p id="firstColor">The two organizations played for the first time on November 7th, 1921 at Chicago. The Bears shut out the Packers 20â€“0 in their first meeting, and the rivalry was born. Then in 1930 Packers shut out the Bears for the fifth consecutive game in this contest which is the longest such 
                streak in the series. The streak began in 1928 when the Packers defeated the Bears. In 1941 The Bears came into the game undefeated and seemingly invincible. Over their first five games, they defeated their rivals by an unprecedented 157 points. However, the Packers upset them in
                 this game which was the Bears lone defeat that season. The Associated Press wrote of the game that the "Chicago Bears myth is broken".</p>
